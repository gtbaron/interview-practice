# Interview Practice

## Description:
A set of practice problems in Java to prepare for entry level developer interviews. These files are meant to be executed 
as standalone Java programs. As a result, each package contains one Java file with a `public static void main(...)` method.
This was done to alleviate the need for any understanding of JUnit or other testing frameworks to allow the candidate to 
focus solely on implementing the exercises in each package. Many of these are typically asked as 'whiteboard' questions and
would not be evaluated through test cases in an interview setting.

### loops:
This package includes exercises in writing the following:
1. Basic `for` loop
2. `For/Each` loop
3. `While` loop using an `Iterator`
4. `Do/While` loo using an index variable
5. Using `streams` to print only certain values from a list

### overriding
This package includes exercises meant to test the developer's basic understanding of overriding methods. The exercises include:
1. Overriding a method inherited from a parent class
2. Implementing an interface and adding the required methods

### strings
This package includes exercises for common string manipulation questions. These include:
1. Reversing a string using different methods
2. Extracting substrings
3. Implement a method that tests whether or not a given string is a palindrome

### trees
This package contains common tree traversal questions using recursion and iteration. These include:
1. Recursive depth-first tree traversals
2. Iterative depth-first tree traversals
3. Breadth-first tree traversals
